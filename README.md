# KB-COACHING

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

Currently the project is working with local databases for plug n' play.

## IDEA

When I'm not coding or googling I'm a coach in kickboxing. I was using the notes on my iPhone to create and manage every kickboxing workout, which as you can imagine got very tiresome :nauseated_face:. So, rather than using notes I decided to create my own webapp, customized to my liking, whilst also increasing my experience with NextJS & Netlify :smiling_face_with_three_hearts:

## Getting Started

First, clone the repo. Rename the file .env.example to .env and change the DEV_URL value:
```bash
DEV_URL=http://localhost:3000
```

Second, install and run the development server and enjoy:

```bash
npm install && npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser of choiche, preferably [Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/) :sunglasses:, to see the result.
