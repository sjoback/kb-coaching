# KB-COACHING

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app) with a [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) connection.

## IDEA

When I'm not coding or googling I'm coaching in kickboxing. I was using the notes on my iPhone to create and manage every kickboxing workout. So rather than using that app I wanted to create a webapp of my own, customized to my liking, whilst also increasing my experience with NextJS.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/workouts](http://localhost:3000/api/workouts)..
